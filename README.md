# Truckbase Take-Home Assignment: Real-Time Stock Dashboard

## Directly spin up project

```
    // root folder
    docker-compose up

    // open localhost:3000
```

## Objective

Create a real-time stock market dashboard that displays stock prices and updates them periodically. The application should have a backend built with Node.js, a frontend with React.js, and utilize SQL for data management.

## Backend (Node.js)

### API Development

Create RESTful APIs using Node.js to handle stock data. This includes:

- An endpoint to fetch current stock prices.
- An endpoint to add new stocks to the watchlist (stored in a SQL database).
- Database Interaction: Use a SQL database to store a watchlist of stocks.
- Design a simple schema to store stock symbols.
- Real-Time Data Streaming: Implement a WebSocket connection or a polling mechanism to stream stock price updates to the frontend.
- Feel free to use a free stock price SDK (I think Yahoo used to have one) or just randomize those $$ values for the purposes of this project.

## Frontend (React.js)

Stock Dashboard: Develop a simple UI to display stock prices.

- It should update in real-time as new data is received from the backend.
- Watchlist Management: Allow users to add stocks to their watchlist. This should interact with the backend to update the database.
- Error Handling and User Feedback: Implement basic error handling and provide feedback for user actions (e.g., adding a stock to the watchlist).

## SQL

Database Schema:

- Write a SQL query to create the necessary table(s) for the watchlist. Include fields like stock symbol, added timestamp, etc.
- Data Retrieval: Write a SQL query to fetch the list of stocks from the watchlist.

## Additional Requirement

- Include a README file with clear instructions on how to set up and run the application.
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Ensure the application is robust and handles edge cases gracefully.
- Bonus points for implementing user management!
- Evaluation Criteria
- Code organization and clarity.
- Correct implementation of RESTful principles and WebSocket/polling mechanism.
- Effective use of SQL for data storage and retrieval.
- Functionality of the React.js frontend, including real-time updates.
- Error handling and user experience considerations.
- This assignment is designed to evaluate your skills in backend and frontend development, as well as your ability to work with SQL databases and real-time data.

We're looking forward to seeing your approach to solving this challenge!

## Local dev environment setup

```
    // 1st tab
    // root folder
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up

    // 2nd tab
    cd src/server
    npm ci
    cd src
    npx knex migrate:latest
    npm start

    // 3rd tab
    cd src/client
    npm ci
    npm start

```

### Create new migration

```
    cd src/server/src
    npx knex migrate:make create_users_table

    // Latest migration file
    npx knex migrate:latest

    // Rollback last migration
    npx knex migrate:down

    // Run next migration
    npx knex migrate:up
```

### Seed Data

```
    cd src/server/src
    npx knex seed:make 01-users
    npx knex seed:run
```
